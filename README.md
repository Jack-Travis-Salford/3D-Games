# 3D-Games
Salford University Year 3 - 3D&amp;VR Games - Assignment 1. 

Due to GitHubs repo size restriction, I am unable to upload a build or the rest of the project. Please email jacktrav28@gmail.com to receive a download link to the build, or/and project files. 

Although its somewhat redundant to do so, I have uploaded all the scripts I created for this application, or else this would just be an empty repository. However, these files may reflect what knowledge I have with Unity and C#, as well as showing how the player and enemy state machine works.

For this project, I created a first person fighting game, where the player had to fight off waves of Knights with their sword and shield. Power-ups can be picked up by the player to restore their health or boost their health or attack stat. 

This project was developed in Unity, version 2021.3.5f.



The second assignment of this module was creating a 'VR' game, which I have not directly uploaded, also due to the same file size restrictions.

This was developed using Google VR and theoretically would work on a mobile. However, Unity version 2021.3.5f, which was the non-negotiable version I had to use, does not support making .apk files. Likewise, I do not have access to a VR headset, so that wasn't an option either.

We were told that making the VR game work on an actual device was not required for the module, and wasn't worth investing time into, since the project would be marked whilst emulated in the Unity editor. 

Nonetheless, the project files for this assignment may also be requested @jacktrav28@gmail.com
